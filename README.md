# Learning Rust

Welcome to the **Learning Rust** repository! This repository contains all the projects and exercises I've completed to learn and get accustomed to the Rust programming language.

## Projects

Here are the projects I've worked on so far:

1. **FirstWebServer**: A simple web server built with Rust.
2. **LinkedList**: Implementation of a linked list data structure in Rust.
3. **Mandelbrot**: A program to generate Mandelbrot fractals.
4. **Minesweeper-rs**: A clone of the classic Minesweeper game written in Rust.
5. **Raytracer Clone**: A basic raytracer implemented in Rust.
6. **scenario1**: A simple webserver in Rust. Cloned from book "Rust Servers, Services, and Apps".

## Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning-rust.git

```

Then, follow the instructions in each project's README to build and run the project.
